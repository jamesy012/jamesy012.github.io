    <ul>
        <li>Model loading</li>
        <li>Model Animation</li>
        <li>Gpu Shaders</li>
        <li>Post Processing</li>
        <li>Frustum culling</li>
    </ul>

    I added a few extra features from what was required here and there.

    I Implemented Lua bindings into my C++ engine,<br>
    <p>In Lua you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transform creation.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Transform movement.</li>
          <li>Transform rotation.</li>
          <li>Transform parenting.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Mesh/Image creation.</li>
      <li>Camera modifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    all objects are given a number that relates to the object within the C++ code.<br>
    almost like a pointer to the object in c++.<br>
    there is also common Lua files that maintain input and the different types that are usable

       The cubes all use AABB, so when rotated the collider no longer matches up,<br>
       but when working out the angle from the collision I used the angle of the cube, so all the balls will slide to the direction the cube is rotated.

    A rewrite of my last engine currently missing a lot of features compared to the old one.<br>
    I named it Millard because I like ducks :)<br>
    Currently working on this, Since I have an example from my last engine, this one should be structured a lot better<br>
    <br>
    Very early on, so no screenshots atm.<br>
    Currently only has basic texture and model loading, with a resource manager that deals with loading the same file twice

    after a fail attempt at 3d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma4MsfVIqdc">(Youtube Link)</a><br>
    I was determined to make a better version of it!<br>
    While reading about ray-casting and how wolfenstein was rendered I set out to make this.
