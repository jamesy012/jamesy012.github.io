      <ul>
          <li>Transform movement.</li>
          <li>Transform rotation.</li>

      <li>Mesh/Image creation.</li>
      <li>Material load and colour</li>
      <li>Camera modifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    All objects are given a number that relates to the object within the C++ code.<br>
    Almost like a pointer to the object in C.<br>
    there is also common Lua files that maintain input and the different data types that are creatable and useable.

       So, whats going on here...<br>
       Well it's a demonstration of my Lua implementation.<br>
       The starting plane is created, colored and scaled within lua.<br>
       It starts off with spawning a bunch of planes assigning them to a array which gives them the bird like movement and applying the texture swap animation.<br>
       I can select planes and control them with WASD and mouse movement.<br>
       Then I spawn a un textured bunny and move that around the scene.<br><br>
       If you want to see the lua code that handles this scene 
       <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jamesy012/aieopengl/src/bc2dfbbee3f4cd8182576028425c625dcc509b31/_WorkingDir/Files/Scripts/ObjectCreationTest.lua?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default">Link.</a><br>
       It does a little more than whats shown here and gives an idea of how the lua aspect of the implementation operates

       The cubes all use AABB, so when rotated the collider no longer matches up,<br>
       but when working out the angle from the collision I used the angle of the cube, so all the balls will slide to the direction the cube is rotated.

    A rewrite of my last engine currently missing a lot of features compared to the old one.<br>
    I named it Millard because I like ducks :)<br>
    Based off my last engine, this one will be structured a lot better since I have a better idea on what certin aspects do.<br>
    <br>
    It is currently very early on.<br>
    Currently has
    <ul>
        <li>Texture loading(stb_image)</li>
        <li>Model loading(Assimp)</li>
        <li>Text rendering(stb_truetype)</li>

        <li>A local version of shader uniform values with a easy way to modify and set the data</li>

        <li>Transform/object system</li>
        <li>Camera, othographic/perspective</li>

    Out of 2390 games my game managed to place.<br><br>
    There were a few gameplay issues such as accidentally getting your boxes on the shelves.<br><br>
    In the end the game was hectic and when a pile of boxes came in it made the player feel overwhelmed which was the intended feeling I was aiming for.<br><br>
    Like when a truck has just left and now you have to go through and organize the pile boxes giving the player something to always be doing.

    Bullet Ballet is a A 3-D single player, top down, flow driven, twin stick shooter inspired by over the top action movies like The Matrix and games like Max Payne, Door Kickers and Stranglehold.<br>   
    <p>
        as a group we worked on this game for around 4-5 months, going though alpha, beta and gold.
    </p>   
    <p>

        What I did:

            <li>I wrote the input dll (allows for ds4 and xbox controllers to be treated the same)</li>
            <li>Player Arm controller</li>
            <li>Player Movement controller</li>
            <li>Player animations</li>
            <li>Fog system</li>
            <li>Enemy AI</li>
            <li>Slowmo system</li>
            <li>Weapon handling/bullet system</li>
            <li>Dash/Dive system</li>

    LD40 theme: The more you have the worse it is.
    <p>The game I made in 48 hours by myself for the ludum dare compo.<br>
        I had alot of fun bring out my graphics tablet and drawing all the paintings and objects.<br>
        Going into this project I was going to create a 2d game since my last project, Bullet Ballet was a 3d game.<br>
        Overall I found the graphics to still be lacking and an aspect I will need to work on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To fit the theme the idea was to keep adding objects into the room, and having the player find a certin object, being the more items you have the harder 
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the scores are still being calulated.
