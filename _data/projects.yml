    I added a few extra features from what was required here and there.

   description: 
    A Implemtation for Lua using bindings built into my C++ OpenGL engine (Link to the side),<br>
    <p>Within Lua you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transform creation.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Transform movement.</li>
          <li>Transform rotation.</li>
          <li>Transform parenting.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Mesh/Image creation.</li>
      <li>Material load and colour</li>
      <li>Camera modifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    All objects are given a number that relates to the object within the C++ code.<br>
    Almost like a pointer to the object in C.<br>
    there is also common Lua files that maintain input and the different data types that are creatable and useable.

       So, whats going on here...<br>
       Well it's a demonstration of my Lua implementation.<br>
       The starting plane is created, colored and scaled within lua.<br>
       It starts off with spawning a bunch of planes assigning them to a array which gives them the bird like movement and applying the texture swap animation.<br>
       I can select planes and control them with WASD and mouse movement.<br>
       Then I spawn a un textured bunny and move that around the scene.<br><br>
       If you want to see the lua code that handles this scene 
       <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jamesy012/aieopengl/src/bc2dfbbee3f4cd8182576028425c625dcc509b31/_WorkingDir/Files/Scripts/ObjectCreationTest.lua?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default">Link.</a><br>
       It does a little more than whats shown here and gives an idea of how the lua aspect of the implementation operates

       The cubes all use AABB, so when rotated the collider no longer matches up,<br>
       but when working out the angle from the collision I used the angle of the cube, so all the balls will slide to the direction the cube is rotated.

    Currently working on this, Since I have an example from my last engine, this one should be structured a lot better<br>
    <br>
    Very early on, so no screenshots for the moment.<br>
    Currently only has

        <li>Text rendering(stb_truetype)</li>

        <li>A local version of shader uniform values with a easy way to modify and set the data</li>

    Out of 2390 games my game managed to place.<br><br>
    There were a few gameplay issues such as accidentally getting your boxes on the shelves.<br><br>
    In the end the game was hectic and when a pile of boxes came in it made the player feel overwhelmed which was the intended feeling I was aiming for.<br><br>
    Like when a truck has just left and now you have to go through and organize the pile boxes giving the player something to always be doing.
