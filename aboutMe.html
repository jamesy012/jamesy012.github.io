        I am James, a Programmer from Melbourne who got started by learning attempting to learn Ipod app development just after primary school.
    </p>
    <p>
        After making a simple tap the screen to change color app I looked into another language, learning Java and C++ through YouTube.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having made a console based text adventure in C++ I looked into graphics, not knowing much about C++ I turned to Java with Swing after finding a site which had source code for a Tetris clone.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was continuing to look into how it was made and making changes to it to see what happen, I learnt the majority of how to start game dev from this Tetris source. I made a version that was straight shapes only as a 'hacked' version.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then striped the Tetris out of the source and made pong game and over the next few years during highschool I used that same framework with slight upgrades to make different demos and small games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around 2012-2013 I got an Android phone and realised I could use my java skills to make Android games too, getting a few of those apps on the play store, one of them got a few thousand downloads.
    </p>
    <p>
        throughout that time I attempted other languages, such as using unity with both JavaScript and C#, made some simple html sites and I also used game maker a lot to make languages 
    </p>
    <p>
        After entering AIE in 2016 they taught me C++ and C# with unity during the first year, and over the break I looked into how to use OpenGL
