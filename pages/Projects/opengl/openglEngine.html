project:
 name: OpenGL Engine - Millard
 description: >
  A rewrite of my last engine currently missing a lot of features compared to the old one.<br>
  I named it Millard because I like ducks :)<br>
  Currently working on this, Since I have an example from my last engine, this one should by structured alot better<br>
  <br>
  Very early on, so no screenshots atm.<br>
  Currently only has basic texture and model loading, with a resource manager that deals with loading the same file twice
