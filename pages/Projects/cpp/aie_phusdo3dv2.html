 description: >
  During my first year at AIE I was making different examples just to improve my skill,<br>
  after a fail attempt at 3d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma4MsfVIqdc">(Youtube Link)</a><br>
  I was determined to make a better version of it!<br>
  While reading about raycasting and how wolfenstein was rendered I set out to make this.
